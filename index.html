					<p>T'ai Chi Chuan is an art and system of movement based on internal strength. Every action should 
					be an integrated movement of the whole body expressing a focused intention. It is a healthy and 
					relaxing exercise, a martial art and form of self defence. It is also an aid to personal development 
					as well as an enjoyable activity in itself.</p>
					
					<p>We practice the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen-style_tai_chi_chuan"><strong>Chen 
					family style</strong></a> which is the oldest and parent form of other <a title="Tai chi chuan" 
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi_chuan">tai chi chuan</a> styles. Chen style is characterised 
					by its lower stances, more explicit 
					<a title="Silk reeling" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_reeling">Silk reeling</a> and bursts of 
					power (<a title="Fa jin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa_jin">fa jin</a>). The University Tai Chi 
					Society practises the Laojia form, silk-reeling, qigong and and partner work.</p>
					
					<p>Classes are taught by Andrew Gibson. Andy has been practicing and teaching for many years, and has 
					introduced many people to Tai Chi.</p>

					<em>Tuesday classes</em> are excellent for beginners. They focus on "Silk Reeling" exercises (Chansigong) and first 
					section of the Tai Chi Hand Form (Laojia Yilu). These basics are the building blocks of Chen style Tai Chi Chuan, 
					and remain a core practice at all levels.</p>
					
					<p><em>Friday classes</em> are suitable for all levels. The focus is on progressing through the hand form, and 
					deepening practice. As such, the pace and level may be more challenging.</p>

					<p>Andy has been practicing Taijiquan for 26 years. He began learning Cheng Manching short form at EU Tai Chi Soc in 
					1984 under Stephen Fox, taking over teaching in 1995 when Stephen retired. Throughout the nineties, Andy attended a 
					number of seminars with Mike Sigman and Zhan Xue Xin, and dabbled in Chen style. Since 2001 he has taken regular 
					tuition in traditional Chen Taiji with Eva Koskuba of the Chinese Internal Arts Association. After learning the 
					Laojia Yi Lu (old frame, first form), E.U. Tai Chi Soc changed to a Chen style class. Andy continues to study Taiji 
					at regular seminars and courses, and has recently completed training in Xinjia (new frame) Yi Lu (first form) 
					and Chen saber form.</p>

					<p>Perhaps most importantly, Andy is a laid back, conscientous and helpful teacher, who is good for a laugh while 
					we practise.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="tabs-4">
					<p>We hold regular seminars with Eva and Karel Koskuba from the <a
					href="http://www.ciaa.org.uk/">Chinese Internal Arts Assocation</a>.
					Eva usually visits several times a year to teach qigong and the
					Laojia form. These seminars are an excellent opportunity to improve
					all aspects of your Tai Chi.</p>

					<p><b>When is it?</b><br/>The next seminar is on the weekend of the
					6th/7th of July. The following one will be the 26th/27th of October.</p>

					<p><b>What is this / who is Eva?</b><br/>
					This seminar will be a weekend of intensive Chen Style Taiji Quan!
					This will be an excellent opportunity to rapidly and dramatically
					improve your Taiji, and to practice with other Chen style Taiji
					players of a high level.</p>

					<p>Eva is a skilled and approachable high-level teacher, and is very
					effective in transmitting her understanding of Taiji Quan and Qigong.
					She has trained with some of the top people, including Chen Xiaowang,
					standard bearer of the Chen style. Practice at the seminars can be as
					challenging as you wish, and is very enjoyable. The regulars who
					attend are all very sociable.</p>

					<p>The University Society has arranged a subsidy for members'
					attendance at the seminar. Please </p>

					<p><b>Date, Location & Schedule:</b><br/>, 6th and 7th of July, 2013 at <a
					href="http://www.chentaichiscotland.com/venues/st_stephens_centre.cgi">St
					Steven's Centre</a>, Edinburgh.</p>

					<p>The seminars usually run from 10 AM until 5 PM on both days.
					From 10:00 until 13:00 on Saturday, Qigong and Taiji silk-reeling
					exercises will be taught and practiced. For the rest of the weekend,
					Chen-style Taiji Quan will be taught. There will be a break for lunch
					from approximately 13:00 to 14:00, and rest breaks during the course
					of the day.</p>

					<p>If you wish to attend one of the seminars, please speak to a
					committee member at any of the regular practise sessions, or <a
					href="mailto:taichi@ed.ac.uk">get in touch</a>. The University
					Society has arranged a subsidy for members' attendance at the
